                		<h3>Education</h3>
                		<p>I spent my childhood going to the local elementary, middle & high schools in San Clemente California. I graduated from San Clemente High School with honors in 2012. Because of my grades, I was awarded a lot of scholarships and received quite a few acceptance letters from different universities across the country. I spent some time traveling around with my parents to visit the different schools doing campus tours in order to help me decide where I would like to attend. In the end, I decided I wanted to stay closer to home and accepted an offer to attend the University of California Irvine. In my senior year, I did an exchange program and spent a semester studying abroad in Manchester, England. In 2016, I graduated from UCI with a bachelor’s degree in criminology.</p>

                		<h3>Career</h3>
                		<p>Throughout my childhood, it was always my dream to follow my mother’s footsteps and get a job within the government. My dream was to become an FBI agent. After college, I applied to join the TSA in order to get my foot in the door with a government position. I was accepted and offered a position, however, I turned down the job due to the low salary. A friend of mine that I knew from working in a jewelry store at the local mall in California had become a recruiter and set me up with a temp position at a company in Irvine called Accurate Background. This was a California company that ran employment background checks for companies all across the world. After my temp position came to an end I was offered a full time role starting at the bottom as somebody who processed background checks. From there I was able to work my way up into a position as an account representative working along side contacts at Amazon, who is our companies largest client. In 2019, my company allowed me to work remote from Northern Washington, which worked out well for both me and the company as it offered me the ability to live near my long distance boyfriend (turned husband), and also go in and visit with my clients in person at their Seattle headquarters. Since then, I have continued to work my way up and now hold the position of Senior Account Manager where I work along side clients at Amazon and manage background checks for warehouse workers and drivers across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.</p>
