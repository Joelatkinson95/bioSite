				<p>My name is Remi Atkinson (Sidman). I was born in San Clemente hospital in San Clemente California on September 7th 1994. I grew up living an amazing middle class lifestyle enjoying all of the beauty and attractions that Southern California has to offer. I spent my childhood enjoying the beach and the ocean almost every day. It is my happy place. I had an amazing family life growing up with two loving parents, and a younger sister who has become my best friend into adulthood. My life has given me incredible opportunities to get an education, study abroad, and graduate from the University of California Irvine with a bachelorâ€™s degree in criminology. I was able to use my experience and education to get my foot in the door with a fantastic company, where I have worked my way up the ladder into a prestigious position as a senior account manager. I love to travel and have been to 13 countries and counting. I currently live an amazing life in the suburbs of Phoenix Arizona with my husband, our 1 year old daughter, & our dog Elvis. I am surrounded by an amazing group of friends and family who offer me endless love, support, & companionship. Looking at my life, I am the type of person who is always striving for more and has goals and aspirations to achieve more in life regardless of how much I have. However, taking a step back and looking at the life I have built, I can honestly say that I am extremely happy and blessed.</p>
