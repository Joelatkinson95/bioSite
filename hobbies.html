				<h3>Travel</h3>
				<p>My favorite hobby is traveling. No matter what, I always want to have at least one trip booked in order to have something to look forward to and continue to see the world. In my senior year of college, I studied abroad in Manchester, England. This allowed me to not only live and experience the U.K, but also to take cheap and easy flights all over Europe on my weekends. I have visited 13 countries and counting. I love to travel around the U.S. as well. I enjoy visiting national parks and seeing the beauty that our country has to offer. My favorite place too visit is Hawaii. My husband and I go to Hawaii at least once a year and it is always somewhere that we look forward to visiting. My dream vacation that I must do before I die is visit a wildlife safari in Africa.</p>

                		<h3>Food</h3>
				<p>I am a big foodie. I not only love food but also love the experience that dining has to offer. In my day to day life I canâ€™t think of many things that I enjoy more than a nice dinner out at a restaurant with my friends or family. Growing up in Southern California and now living in Arizona I have grown up with amazing Mexican food so naturally that is my favorite. I also really enjoy sushi, steak, cheese boards, and red wine. Especially if it is on a patio for happy hour.</p>

                		<h3>Working Out</h3>
                		<p>I love to exercise. I spend multiple days a week at the gym doing workouts or participating in exercise classes. This allows me to focus on myself and have some time away from everything where I can enjoy pushing myself to the limits to create the best version of myself that I can.</p>

				<h3>Family Time and Friends</h3>
				<p> I have become a fan of the simple life, I enjoy spending time at home with my family just watching tv on nights in, or doing DIY home improvements on the weekends. I also have an amazing group of close knit friends who I love to spend time with, whether that be lounging out by the pool, going out for brunch or to the farmers markets, or even just staying in and having a quiet night with some drinks and a board game.</p>
