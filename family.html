                		<h3>Parents</h3>
                		<p>My mom was born in Ohio but spent majority of her young life in the suburbs of Chicago. She attended Indiana University and eventually became a police officer. She was the first woman police officer in the town of Naperville Illinois. She eventually accepted a position asa an investigator/special agent for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management where she worked conducting background investigations for newly hired federal employees and for military personnel who were attempting to gain higher security clearance within the government. She moved to San Diego California in the late 1980’s to live with her sister who was stationed there in the military. This is where she met my father. My father was born in California but was raised in Hilo Hawaii. He spent his childhood living a more relaxed island lifestyle working in the tourism industry and driving a truck delivering produce. In his 30’s he decided that there wasn’t anything left for him in Hawaii and moved to California for more opportunity. From there he went to barber college and earned his real estate license. He started a career as a barber and realtor in the Southern California area. For most of his adult life he ran his own barber shop in Dana Point California called Aloha Barber. My parents got married in September of 1991 and bought a house in San Clemente California where they still live today.</p>

                		<h3>Husband and His Family</h3>
                		<p>I met my husband in Las Vegas in September of 2017. After about a year and a half of long distance dating, I moved up to the Washington State / Canada border to be close to him as he lived only 15 minutes across the border in Chilliwack British Columbia, Canada. In June of 2019 we got married and started the paperwork process for him to immigrate to the United States. In June of 2021 it was finally approved and we moved to the suburbs of Phoenix Arizona where we still live today. He has two loving parents and an older sister. They still all live in Chilliwack British Columbia. His sister is married and has two young boys.</p>
